Account deletion in the Tody app.

All Data is generally only stored locally on your device. 
If you set up a DataSync, your data will be stored on a remote server. 
To delete a DataSync go the the DataSync settings menu and push the red "Delete" button.  
Only the owner of a DataSync can it and it requires a confirmation login.
