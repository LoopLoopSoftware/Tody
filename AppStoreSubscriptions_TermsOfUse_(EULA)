By purchasing a subscription for Tody ("Subscription"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"), which govern your use of the Subscription and the premium features offered through the Tody app ("App"). Please read these Terms carefully before purchasing any Subscription.

2. Free Trial Period

Tody offers a 30-day free trial period ("Free Trial") for new users to experience the premium features of the App. During the Free Trial, you will have access to all premium features available in the App. After the Free Trial period has ended, your Subscription will automatically convert to a paid Subscription, and your payment method on file with the Apple App Store will be charged the applicable Subscription fee unless you cancel your Subscription before the end of the Free Trial.

Subscriptions are auto-renewing and will continue to renew until canceled by the user. The Subscription fee will be charged to your payment method on file with the Apple App Store at the then-current rate. Your Subscription will automatically renew for the same duration as your initial Subscription period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the renewal date.

To manage or cancel your Subscription, please follow the instructions provided by the Apple App Store.

4. Premium Features

Your Subscription unlocks premium features within the App, including but not limited to additional tools, resources, and functionalities. The specific premium features available depend on the type of Subscription you have purchased.

5. DataSync Sharing

Certain Subscriptions allow you to share premium features with other Tody users by inviting them to join a DataSync. By sharing your Subscription through DataSync, you grant the invited users access to the premium features included in your Subscription. You are responsible for managing the users you invite and may revoke access at any time through the App's settings.

6. Refunds and Cancellations

Refunds and cancellations are managed by the Apple App Store according to their policies. Tody is not responsible for processing refunds or cancellations.

7. Changes to Subscription Products

Tody reserves the right to modify or discontinue any Subscription product at any time without prior notice. If a Subscription product is discontinued, you will be notified, and your Subscription will be terminated at the end of your current billing period. You will not be charged for any future billing periods.

8. Termination

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the premium features at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice, effective immediately. This includes, but is not limited to, situations where we believe you have violated these Terms, engaged in fraudulent or illegal activities, or misused the App or Subscription.
